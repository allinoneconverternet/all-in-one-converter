# Privacy: No Uploads — How It Works

When you convert a file here, **nothing is uploaded to our servers**. All processing happens *locally in your browser* using WebAssembly (WASM) and Web Workers. That’s why there are no file-size limits and it even works offline after the page loads.

<div class="callout"><strong>TL;DR</strong> — Your files stay on your device. We send you code, not your data.</div>

## The architecture at a glance

  <figcaption>WASM runs the converter entirely inside your browser sandbox. No network calls touch your files.</figcaption>
</figure>

1. You open a converter page (e.g., “MP4 → MP3”).  
2. The page downloads the converter **code** (WASM bundle + JS glue).  
3. The converter runs **on your device** in a Web Worker — your file bytes never leave the browser.  
4. The resulting file is offered back as a local download.

### Why WebAssembly?

- **Near-native speed** in a secure browser sandbox.  
- **Portability** — the same binary runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android.  
- **Privacy by design** — the WASM module processes bytes in memory; no server round-trip is required.

### Workers, not servers

WASM executes inside a **Web Worker** (separate thread) to keep the UI responsive. Workers don’t get arbitrary network access to your files — they receive only the ArrayBuffers you send them.

## How we avoid uploads

</figure>

- We never `POST` your file to an API.  
- We don’t create shadow copies on a backend.  
- Network requests only fetch static assets (HTML, JS, WASM) and optional help images — **never your files**.

## Offline & airplane-mode

After the page loads once, the converter can work **offline**:
- The UI and WASM are cached by the browser.  
- You can disconnect from the internet and finish the conversion.  
- Re-open the page later; if it’s cached, it still works.

## What we log (and what we don’t)

We keep usage metrics at the **page level** (e.g., “/convert/mp4-to-mp3 was opened”) to improve quality. We do **not** log or transmit:
- File contents or filenames  
- Thumbnails/previews derived from your file  
- Partial file chunks or hashes tied to a user

## Security boundaries in the browser

- Files are handled as **blobs / ArrayBuffers**; they never leave the browser unless you export them.  
- WebAssembly runs in the browser’s **sandbox** — no raw disk access, no privileged syscalls.  
- You always stay in control: close the tab to stop processing; clear your browser cache to remove code assets.

## FAQ

### Are my files ever uploaded?
No. The converter runs locally in your browser using WebAssembly. Your files never leave your device.

### Can you see which files I convert?
No. We don’t receive filenames, contents, or previews. Aggregate, page-level metrics only.

### Does it work offline?
Yes. Once the page and WASM have loaded, you can go offline and complete conversions.

### Why do I still see network activity?
That’s your browser fetching **static assets** (like the WASM binary or this documentation). Those requests don’t contain your files.

### Is this as accurate as a server converter?
Yes for most formats. We ship the same open-source engines (e.g., FFmpeg, PDF tooling) compiled to WASM.

### Is it safe to close the tab during a conversion?
Yes. You’re in control locally. Closing the tab cancels processing; no data leaves your device.
